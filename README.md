# datawhys-content-dplyr

This repository contains [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) training content for the [DataWhys](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1918751&HistoricalAwards=false) project in the form of JupyterLab notebooks (.ipynb files).

These notebooks are completely portable to all JupyterLab environments but require the [Blockly R extension](https://github.com/aolney/jupyterlab-blockly-r-extension) for the full user experience.

These materials are in the R language. 
For a full course of R data science training materials, see [here](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-content-notebooks-r).

The `dplyr` content here is designed for users who already have experience with statistical analysis but not R, Jupyter, or blocks programming. 

If you've never used Jupyter or want to try the Blockly extension, check out the tutorial video below.
